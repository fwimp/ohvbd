        Sequences","description":"This dataset contains INSDC sequence records not
        associated with environmental sample identifiers or host organisms. The dataset
        is prepared periodically using the public ENA API (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/)
        by querying data with search parameters: `environmental_sample=False & host=\"\"`
        EMBL-EBI also publishes other records in separate datasets (https://www.gbif.org/publisher/ada9d123-ddb4-467d-8891-806ea8d94230).
        The data was then processed as follows: 1. Human sequences were excluded.
        2. For non-CONTIG records, the sample accession number (when available) along
        with the scientific name were used to identify sequence records corresponding
        to the same individuals (or group of organism of the same species in the same
        sample). Only one record was kept for each scientific name/sample accession
        number. 3. Contigs and whole genome shotgun (WGS) records were added individually.
        4. The records that were missing some information were excluded. Only records
        associated with a specimen voucher or records containing both a location AND
        a date were kept. 5. The records associated with the same vouchers are aggregated
        together. 6. A lot of records left corresponded to individual sequences or
        reads corresponding to the same organisms. In practise, these were \"duplicate\"
        occurrence records that weren''t filtered out in STEP 2 because the sample
        accession sample was missing. To identify those potential duplicates, we grouped
        all the remaining records by `scientific_name`, `collection_date`, `location`,
        `country`, `identified_by`, `collected_by` and `sample_accession` (when available).
        Then we excluded the groups that contained more than 50 records. The rationale
        behind the choice of threshold is explained here: https://github.com/gbif/embl-adapter/issues/10#issuecomment-855757978
        7. To improve the matching of the EBI scientific name to the GBIF backbone
        taxonomy, we incorporated the ENA taxonomic information. The kingdom, Phylum,
        Class, Order, Family, and genus were obtained from the ENA taxonomy checklist
        available here: http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/taxonomy/sdwca.zip
