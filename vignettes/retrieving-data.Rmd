## Introduction

The ohvbd package allows you to retrieve data from many different databases directly.

Currently these databases include the [VecTraits](https://vectorbyte.crc.nd.edu/vectraits-explorer) and [VecDyn](https://vectorbyte.crc.nd.edu/vecdyn-datasets) projects from [VectorByte](https://www.vectorbyte.org/), and [GBIF](https://gbif.org).

Let's imagine you wanted to figure out where there is trait data for a particular vector species - _Aedes aegypti_, for example. Here's how you'd use `ohvbd` to do that:

```{r exemplar, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
df <- search_hub("Aedes aegypti", "vt") |>
  fetch() |>
  glean(
    cols = c("Interactor1Genus", "Interactor1Species", "Latitude", "Longitude"),
    returnunique = TRUE
  )
df
```

Great, lovely. But now... what does that all mean? And how can you build up your own data request? Read on to find out...

## A note before we begin

```{r starttimer, include=FALSE}
runstart <- lubridate::now()
vcr::setup_knitr()
```

```{r option, include=FALSE}
# Suppress cli output in non-interactive mode
if (!rlang::is_interactive()) {
  options(cli.default_handler = function(msg) invisible(NULL))
} else {
  options(cli.default_handler = NULL)
}
```

For users who are familiar with base R pipes (`|>`), this approach is generally usable in ohvbd as well.

For users who are not familiar, pipes take the output of one command and feed it forward to the next command as the first argument:


```{r nonpipedemo}
# Find mean of a vector normally
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
mean(x)
```

```{r pipedemo}
# Find mean of a vector using pipes
c(1, 2, 3) |> mean()
```

For the rest of this vignette we will be using a piped-style approach.

## Finding IDs

Datasets in VecTraits and VecDyn, and GBIF are organised by id.

You can search for ids related to a particular query using the `vbdhub.org` (aka "the hub") search functionality via `search_hub()`.

In this case let's search the hub for *Aedes aegypti*, the "Yellow Fever mosquito":

```{r search_hub, cassette="aedes_hub_search"}
library(ohvbd)
aedes_results <- search_hub("Aedes aegypti")
summary(aedes_results)
```

You can see here there are 20 GBIF datasets, 10 VecDyn datasets, and 71 VecTraits datasets.

However right now we only have the ids of the data, not the data themselves. In order to get that, we must fetch the data from a given database.

## Filtering dbs

Before fetching data, we must extract only the ids relevant to our database from our search.

> GBIF, VecTraits, and VecDyn do not have unified ids between datasets, so if you attempted to get VT ids from another database you would (at best) get garbage.

Filtering database results from searches can be performed using the `filter_db()` command:

```{r filter_search}
aedes_vt <- filter_db(aedes_results, "vt")
aedes_vt
```

If you only searched the hub for one database, by default `search_hub()` will automatically perform the `filter_db()` operation for you!

```{r autofilter, cassette="aedes_hub_search_vt"}
search_hub("Aedes aegypti", db = "vt")
```

## Getting data

Now you have a vector of datasets from vectraits, we need to actually retrieve the data of these datasets through the API.

To do this we can use the `fetch()` function. In this case let's get the first 5 *Aedes aegypti* datasets:

```{r fetch_vt, results='hide', cassette="aedes_vt_data"}
aedes_vt <- aedes_vt |> head(5)
aedes_responses <- aedes_vt |> fetch()
aedes_responses[[1]]
```
```
## <httr2_response>
## GET https://vectorbyte.crc.nd.edu/portal/api/vectraits-dataset/474/?format=json
## Status: 200 OK
## Content-Type: application/json
## Body: In memory (52292 bytes)
```

The `fetch()` function returns a list of the data in the form of the original `httr2` responses. These are useful if you want to know specifics about how the server sent data back, but for most usecases it is more useful to extract the data into a dataframe.

### Specific fetch functions

`fetch()` retrieves data from the appropriate database for your data. Under the hood it farms out this work to the `fetch_x()` series of functions.

You can use these yourself for extra piece of mind, though we do not really recommend it.

So the above code could also be written as:

```{r fetch_vt_specific, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
aedes_responses <- aedes_vt |> fetch_vt()
```

## Extracting data

Now we have a list of responses, we can extract the relevant data from them using the `glean()` function.

```{r extract_all_vt}
aedes_data <- aedes_responses |> glean()
cat("Data dimensions: ", ncol(aedes_data), " cols x ", nrow(aedes_data), " rows")
```

This dataset is a bit too large to print here, and often you may only want a few columns of data rather than the whole dataset.

Fortunately the `cols` argument allows us to filter this data out easily. We can also use the argument `returnunique` to instruct ohvbd to return only unique rows.

So let's get just the unique locations and trait name combinations from our data using the same command as before:

```{r extract_filtered_vt}
aedes_data_filtered <- aedes_responses |>
  glean(
    cols = c("Location", "OriginalTraitName"),
    returnunique = TRUE
  )
aedes_data_filtered
```

### Specific glean functions

Like `fetch()`, `glean()` has database-specific variants:

```{r glean_vt_specific, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
aedes_data <- aedes_responses |> glean_vt()
```

## Putting it all together

In day-to-day use, you will mostly find yourself using all these functions together to create small pipelines.

A typical pipeline would likely only contain a few lines of code:

```{r vt_pipeline_hub, cassette="aedes_hub_pipeline"}
df <- search_hub("Aedes aegypti") |>
  filter_db("vt") |>
  head(5) |>
  fetch() |>
  glean(
    cols = c("Interactor1Genus", "Interactor1Species", "Latitude", "Longitude"),
    returnunique = TRUE
  )
head(df)
```

A similar pipeline taking advantage of the autofiltering in `search_hub()` might look like this:

```{r vt_pipeline_hub_autofilter, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
df <- search_hub("Aedes aegypti", db = "vt") |>
  head(5) |>
  fetch() |>
  glean(
    cols = c("Interactor1Genus", "Interactor1Species", "Latitude", "Longitude"),
    returnunique = TRUE
  )
```

## Smart searching of VectorByte databases

One subtlety of VectorByte (in particular) is to do with field collisions.

Let's imagine that we are looking for traits of whitefly species (*Bemisia*). We can just construct a query to investigate this as follows:

```{r demo_searcherror, cassette="Bemisia_hub_search"}
df <- search_hub("Bemisia", "vt") |>
  head(6) |>
  fetch() |>
  glean(
    cols = c(
      "DatasetID",
      "Interactor1Genus",
      "Interactor1Species",
      "Interactor2Genus",
      "Interactor2Species"
      )
    )
```
Now we would expect this to be traits of *Bemisia* spp, however when we look at the `Interactor1Genus` column we see something a touch odd:

```{r unique_genus}
unique(df$Interactor1Genus)
```

*Axinoscymnus* is a ladybird, but why is it appearing? Let's look at only rows containing *Axinoscymnus*:

```{r filter_ladybirds}
df |> dplyr::filter(Interactor1Genus == "Axinoscymnus") |> head()
```

In this scenario, *Bemisia* is present in the dataset, but it is as the "target" rather than the animal that the trait is referring to.

As such we might want to be more specific about precisely which data to retrieve. Enter the `search_x_smart()` family of functions.

These allow you to construct a more specific search.

So let's construct the same search as we were wanting to do before, but with the smart search.

```{r searcherror_fixed, cassette="Bemisia_vt_search"}
df <- search_vt_smart("Interactor1Genus", "contains", "Bemisia") |>
  head(6) |>
  fetch() |>
  glean(
    cols = c(
      "DatasetID",
      "Interactor1Genus",
      "Interactor1Species",
      "Interactor2Genus",
      "Interactor2Species"
      )
    )
unique(df$Interactor1Genus)
```

Here we have made sure to only search the `Interactor1Genus` column. As such we have only gotten back *Bemisia* traits!

This same sort of collision is particularly common in the "Citation" column, where papers may mention multiple trait names.

The `search_x_smart()` functions have many different operators and columns that they can work upon. For full details, run `?search_vt_smart` or `?search_vd_smart` in your console.

In general it is always worthwhile inspecting the data you retrieve to make sure that your query returned the data that you thought it did.

## Futher steps

From here you now have all the data you might need for further analysis, so now it's down to you!

One final note to end on: it can be advisable to save any output data in a csv or parquet format so that you do not need to re-download it every time you run your script. This is as easy as running `write.csv()` on your dataframe, then reading it in later with `read.csv()`

```{r tot_time, include=FALSE}
tot_time <- lubridate::as.duration(lubridate::now() - runstart)
```
