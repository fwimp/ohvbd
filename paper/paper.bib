Modern One Health tends to focus on zoonotic pathogens emerging from wildlife and production animal species, but one of the most significant One Health challenges is rabies for which there is a canine reservoir. This review considers the role of small companion animals in One Health and specifically addresses the major vector-borne infectious diseases that are shared by man, dogs and cats. The most significant of these are leishmaniosis, borreliosis, bartonellosis, ehrlichiosis, rickettsiosis and anaplasmosis. The challenges that lie ahead in this field of One Health are discussed, together with the role of the newly formed World Small Animal Veterinary Association One Health Committee.},

  abstract = {Vector-borne diseases are responsible for more than 17\% of human cases of infectious diseases. In most situations, effective control of debilitating and deadly vector-bone diseases (VBDs), such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, Zika and Chagas requires up-to-date, robust and comprehensive information on the presence, diversity, ecology, bionomics and geographic spread of the organisms that carry and transmit the infectious agents. Huge gaps exist in the information related to these vectors, creating an essential need for campaigns to mobilise and share data. The publication of data papers is an effective tool for overcoming this challenge. These peer-reviewed articles provide scholarly credit for researchers whose vital work of assembling and publishing well-described, properly-formatted datasets often fails to receive appropriate recognition. To address this, GigaScience’s sister journal GigaByte partnered with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to publish a series of data papers, with support from the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), hosted by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Here we outline the initial results of this targeted approach to sharing data and describe its importance for controlling VBDs and improving public health.},

  abstract = {Background Bluetongue virus serotype 3 (BTV-3) was detected for the first time in cattle and sheep in southern England in 2023, the first UK BTV incursion for more than 15 years. Clinical signs were not observed, yet severe clinical disease and mortality were reported during recent BTV-3 outbreaks in northern Europe. Methods To investigate the clinical disease and infection kinetics associated with this UK BTV-3 strain, five British sheep were infected with a UK BTV-3 isolate using Culicoides biting midges. Clinical signs, pathology, infection dynamics, immune responses and Culicoides infection rates were assessed. Results All sheep were infected with BTV-3 and developed mild to moderate clinical bluetongue disease, characterised by fever, haemorrhagic diarrhoea, lameness, depression and widespread petechial haemorrhage. Three sheep reached clinical humane endpoints and were euthanased. Clinical signs/severity, infection kinetics and immune responses were highly variable. Infectious BTV-3 was isolated from sheep blood up to 28 days postinfection. Limitations The impact of BTV-3 infection on British cattle and infection rate in UK Culicoides require investigation to fully determine the risk of this strain to UK livestock. Conclusions This study confirms the potential impact of a BTV-3 incursion/outbreak on the UK sheep population, highlighting the need for an effective vaccine.},

In particular, climate data often require heavy processing before they can be used for analyses. Here we describe AREAdata, a continually updated, free-to-use online global climate dataset, pre-processed to provide the averages of various climate variables across different administrative units (e.g., countries, states). These are daily estimates, based on the Copernicus Climate Data Store’s ERA-5 data, regularly updated to the near-present and provided as direct downloads from our website (https://pearselab.github.io/areadata/). The daily climate estimates from AREAdata are consistent with other openly available data, but at much finer-grained spatial and temporal scales than available elsewhere. AREAdata complements the existing suite of climate resources by providing these data in a form more readily usable by researchers unfamiliar with GIS data-processing methods, and we anticipate these resources being of particular use to environmental and epidemiological researchers.},

We present bayesTPC, an R package for fitting TPCs to trait responses using the nimble language and machinery as the underlying engine for Markov Chain Monte Carlo. bayesTPC aims to support the adoption of Bayesian approaches in thermal physiology, and promote TPC fitting that adequately quantifies uncertainty.},
