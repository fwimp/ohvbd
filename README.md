## Introduction

`ohvbd` is an R package for retrieving (and parsing) data from a network
of disease vector data sources.

At present this package is very much in its early stages, as such the
internal API may change without warning.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ohvbd from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fwimp/ohvbd", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
