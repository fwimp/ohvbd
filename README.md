## Introduction

`ohvbd` is an R package for retrieving (and parsing) data from a network
of disease vector data sources.

At present this package is very much in its early stages, as such the
internal API may change without warning.

## Databases

`ohvbd` allows for searching and the retrieval of data from the
following data sources:

- [VecTraits](https://vectorbyte.crc.nd.edu/vectraits-explorer)
- [VecDyn](https://vectorbyte.crc.nd.edu/vecdyn-datasets)
- [AreaData](https://pearselab.github.io/areadata/)

## Installation

You can install the development version of ohvbd from
[GitHub](https://github.com/fwimp/ohvbd) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fwimp/ohvbd", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Latest patch notes

<!-- These are auto-pulled from NEWS.md  -->

### ohvbd 0.4.1

- New parallel downloading options for `get_x()` and `get_extract_x()`
  functions.
- These are to be used with caution, as they put significantly more load
  on the server than a sequential run would.
- New argument `check_src` allows for toggling of id-sanity checking for
  most functions.
- `retrieving-data` vignette now contains instructions for the use of
  `search_x_smart()`.

See [changelog](https://fwimp.github.io/ohvbd/news/index.html) for patch
notes for previous versions.
