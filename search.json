GBIF account rgbif package required retrieve data GBIF. account details must also set shown rgbif documentation. definitely useful ohvbd workflows, can used base R pipeline (|>). tested magrittr pipelines work -. New filter_db() command allows filtering one database’s results hub searches. check_db_status() now returns (invisibly) whether databases .

New force_db() function enables one force ohvbd consider particular object particular provenance. match , filter_db() now transparently return ohvbd.ids objects gets . New taxonomy argument search_hub() allows filtering searches GBIF backbone IDs. New match_species() function allows quick flexible matching species names GBIF backbone IDs. New match_country() function allows matching country names WKT polygons via naturalearth. New ohvbd_db(), has_db(), is_from() functions allow quick testing object provenance (according ohvbd). New get_default_ohvbd_cache() function allows custom functions interface cached ohvbd data files. result, clean_ad_cache() removed now unnecessary. search_x_smart() functions can now take \"tags\" search field, enabling support tagged datasets. : Entire code base now continuously formatted using Air v0.7.1. Examples longer wrapped \\dontrun{} runnable installed version package. good chunk functional logic ohvbd now covered unit tests (using vcr package). fetch_vd() longer tries retrieve ids pages data. errors longer expected occur interfacing vectorbyte. Occasionally users use forget fetch() command run search_hub() |> glean() didn’t previously give interpretable error. Vignettes now use vcr massively reduce build time. matter developers ohvbd, users download github build vignettes . ohvbd.ids() now warns fixes problem provide ids duplicate values. intended encourage preserve least one means retrieving citation data later. WKT parsing formatting now significantly robust. Cached AREAData now includes cache timestamp attribute rather separate variable cache file. glean_ad() now correctly returns matrix even 1 row column. gadm spatial files now cached GeoPackage rather shapefiles, leading >50% speedup loading! (Thanks @josiah.rs bluesky suggestion!) see particular improvements trying retrieve 10 ids one go repeatedly running download code day. speedup also applies fetch_vd() hood, particularly running multiple times day.
