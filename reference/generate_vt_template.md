# Generate a vectraits template from a short set of survey responses

Given the large number of fields in vectraits it can be hard to know
which of these you need to fill out. This generator asks a series of
questions to determine what columns should be included in one's dataset.

## Usage

``` r
generate_vt_template()
```

## Value

A character vector containing the column headers of the desired
vectraits template or NULL.
