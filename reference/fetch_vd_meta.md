# Find vecdyn metadata

Find vecdyn metadata

## Usage

``` r
fetch_vd_meta(ids, rate = 5, connections = 2, pb_name = "data", basereq = NA)
```

## Arguments

- ids:

  a numeric ID or numeric vector of ids (preferably in an `ohvbd.ids`
  object) indicating the particular dataset/s to download.

- rate:

  maximum number of calls to the API per second.

- connections:

  number of simultaneous connections to the server at once. Maximum 8.
  **Do not enable unless you really need to** as this hits the server
  significantly harder than usual.

- pb_name:

  the name of the download progress bar

- basereq:

  an [httr2 request](https://httr2.r-lib.org/reference/request.html)
  object, as generated by
  [`vb_basereq()`](https://ohvbd.vbdhub.org/reference/vb_basereq.md). If
  `NA`, uses the default request.

## Value

list of
[`httr2::response`](https://httr2.r-lib.org/reference/response.html)
object
